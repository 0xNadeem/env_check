## Rails Version Support Summary

Based on the Rails upgrade guide analysis and Ruby version compatibility, this gem supports:

### Currently Supported Rails Versions

| Rails Version | Ruby Requirement | env_check Support | Status |
|---------------|------------------|-------------------|---------|
| **Rails 8.0** | Ruby 3.0+ | ✅ Full | Latest |
| **Rails 7.2** | Ruby 3.0+ | ✅ Full | LTS |
| **Rails 7.1** | Ruby 3.0+ | ✅ Full | Maintenance |

### Why This Gem Works Across Rails Versions

1. **Framework Agnostic**: env_check doesn't depend on Rails directly
2. **Pure Ruby**: Uses only standard Ruby libraries (YAML, ENV)
3. **Simple API**: No reliance on Rails-specific methods or constants
4. **Minimal Dependencies**: Only depends on dotenv and yaml gems

### Rails Integration Features

- **Rake Tasks**: Works with all Rails versions that support custom Rake tasks
- **Initializers**: Compatible with Rails initialization process
- **Environment Variables**: Follows Rails conventions for env var naming
- **Configuration**: YAML configuration files work identically across versions

### Testing Matrix

The gem is automatically tested against:
- Ruby 3.0, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4  
- Rails 7.1, 7.2, 8.0 (in CI)
- Ubuntu, macOS, Windows platforms

### Migration Notes

When upgrading Rails versions, env_check configurations remain compatible. The gem follows semantic versioning and maintains backward compatibility.
